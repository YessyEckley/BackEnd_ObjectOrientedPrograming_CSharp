Instructions
Examine the starter project.
Use Visual Studio to create an empty C# console project Week6MortgagePaymentCalculator in your development folder
Using the formula given in the comments for the payment() method, write the code to calculate a loan payment, given the loan amount, the interest rate, and the number of periods. Use precedence instead of parentheses in your code. 
Percentage rate should be divided by 100.
Note that the interest rate is per period, so 12% APR on a monthly period would be 1%, or 0.01.
Guided by the comments in the DisplayTest() method, write code to prompt for input data, call the payment() method, and display the result.
Build and test.
